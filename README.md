#AnyMesh

AnyMesh is a multi-platform, decentralized, auto-discovery, auto-connect mesh networking API.  

Current supported platforms:

* Node.js
* iOS

AnyMesh makes it easy to build a decentralized, multi-platform mesh network on any LAN, without having to manually implement TCP / UDP processes.

All supported platforms work roughly the same way.  Configure each AnyMesh instance with 2 properties:

* Name - a name or identifier for the device / program
* ListensTo - an array of "subscriptions"

> AnyMesh will automatically find and connect to other AnyMesh
> instances.  (One AnyMesh instance per network adapter / IP address.)

Then, to communicate across the network, an instance can send two types of messages:

* Request - send a message to a specific device Name.
* Publish - send a message to any subscriber of your message's "target".

That's all there is to it!
